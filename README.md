* Convolution Basics
* Detection of features in image using various filters  and plotting the outputs of various filters- take one image and perform various kernels (edges and other features)
* other computer vision techniques 
* advanced image-processing techiniques using python using python (PIL and matplotlib and Numpy and CV2)
* basic python and math for deep learning( python lists + backpropagation + coding activation functions)
* simple 3 layer feed forward neural net coding from scratch (use Mitesh khapra notes)
* simple 4-5 layer conv neural net coding from scratch (use internet and gpt for maths )
* coding a multilayer conv neural net using tensorflow (train and test)
* coding a multilayer conv  neural net usin pytorch (train and test)
* tweaking the multilayer conv neural net at different layers to figure out which layer is learning which feature
