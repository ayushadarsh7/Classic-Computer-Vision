* Convolution Basics
  
* Detection of features in image using various filters  and plotting the outputs of various filters- take one image and perform various kernels (edges and other features)

* computer_vision techniques1- Digital Image Formation and low-level processing
Overview and State-of-the-art, Fundamentals of Image Formation, Transformation: Orthogonal, Euclidean, Affine, Projective, etc; Fourier Transform, Convolution and Filtering, Image Enhancement, Restoration, Histogram Processing.


* comp vision techniques2:
Edges - Canny, LOG, DOG; Line detectors (Hough Transform), Corners - Harris and Hessian Affine, Orientation Histogram, SIFT, SURF, HOG, GLOH, Scale-Space Analysis- Image Pyramids and Gaussian derivative filters, Gabor Filters and DWT.

*comp vision techniques3 Image Segmentation
Region Growing, Edge Based approaches to segmentation, Graph-Cut, Mean-Shift, MRFs, Texture Segmentation; Object detection

* Dimensionality Reduction: dimensionality reduction and feature extraction: PCA, LDA        
  

* Deep Learning for CV1: basic python and math for deep learning( python lists + backpropagation + coding activation functions)
                         + code a product rule differentiation(for backpropagation)
  
* Deep Learning for CV2: simple 3 layer feed forward neural net coding from scratch (use Mitesh khapra notes) + use it on simple self dataset
  
* Building a CNN from Scratch : simple 4-5 layer conv neural net coding from scratch (use internet and gpt for maths )
  
* CNN with torch and tensorflow:  coding a multilayer conv neural net using tensorflow (train and test) + pytorch (train and test)
  
* What does a CNN learn: tweaking the multilayer conv neural net at different layers to figure out which layer is learning which feature
