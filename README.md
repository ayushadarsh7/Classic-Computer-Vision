# **Classic Computer Vision Techniques**

## **Repository Overview**


This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that cover key topics in **Computer Vision (CV)**. Each notebook explains the mathematical foundations of a particular technique, followed by practical implementations in Python. The topics covered are essential for anyone looking to understand classic and advanced CV techniques, including feature extraction, edge detection, image segmentation, and dimensionality reduction.

The topics offer a comprehensive understanding of **CV fundamentals**.

## How to use for learning?
* clone the repo
* follow the sequence of notebooks from 1 to 7
* each notebook has theory and code implementation of particular topics in python
* Theory has Mathematics and Logic behind each technique and code has its implementation
* The image used in notebooks as an example is ```Cat.jpg``` present in the repo itself.
